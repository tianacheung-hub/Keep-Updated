<p>Hi, this is a website dedicated for Latymer students to be provided with information in a more efficient and clearer way. This is from an educational point of view where there are resources, articles and information available. As well as being a forum for people to be informed and understand  history that the curriculum does not cover BME/BIPOC history. We aim to keep the momentum going and hopefully whilst being in lockdown, you can still educate yourself further and become a better ally.</p>
<p> Also, this is a forum for all students and teachers, so, if you would like to add something to this website then please send the document or resource <a href="mailto:y14tiche@latymer.co.uk">here</a></p>
<p>If you want to write a blog or check out petitions and email templates, then go check out Zahra's BAME LDN page <a href="https://zahra-rahman.github.io/BAME-LDN.github.io/page2-about/page2-about.html">here!</a></p>

- ACS society are in the process of creating a BLM board for the Great Hall, although it is a way to appreciate and commemorate Black Men and Women's history and work, we believe it shouldn't stop there. So please try to educate yourself, and look at the resource pages below. </p>
<p>
- As changing the curriculum is an ongoing discussion, it is a long term process, so the English as well as History department are looking for ways to incorporate educating students whether that be through extra curriculum or on a student's own accord.</P>
<p>
- If you would like to be apart of an open discussion based on History that isn't taught in the curriculum, <a href="mailto:y14tiche@latymer.co.uk">press this email<a/> and let us know and you will be added to a google classroom.
<p>
