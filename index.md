<p>Hi, this is a website dedicated for Latymer students to be provide with information in a more efficient and clearer way. This is from an educational point of view where there are resources, articles and information available. As well as being a forum for people to be informed as well as understand history as the curriculum does not cover BME/BIPOC history. We aim to keep the momentum going and hopefully whilst being in lockdown, you can still educate yourself further and become a better ally.</p>
<p> Also, this is a forum for all students and teachers, so, if you would like to add something to this website then please send the document or resource <a href="mailto:y14tiche@latymer.co.uk">here</a></p>
